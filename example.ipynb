    "## Step 7: Inspecting Epochs for Bad Channels or Trials\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with EEG data, one crucial step in preprocessing is inspecting the epochs for bad channels or trials. This step involves a detailed visual inspection of the epochs to identify channels or trials that contain excessive noise or artifacts, often due to hardware malfunctions, bad electrode contact, or non-neural physiological activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad channels can be characterized by a consistent, extreme difference in signal amplitude compared to the other channels. They might appear as flat (indicating a lost or disconnected electrode) or excessively noisy (possibly due to a poor electrode-skin contact).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, bad trials may contain excessive artifacts that occur due to participant movements, blinks, or other temporary disruptions. These trials will have atypical and potentially extreme values at any channel when compared to the majority of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the decision to label a channel or trial as \"bad\" often requires expert judgment. However, some general guidelines can help. For instance, if a channel exhibits a flat signal, extreme noise, or non-physiological activity patterns consistently across trials, it's likely a bad channel. On the other hand, if only certain trials show such behavior, then these are probably bad trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon identifying these bad channels and trials, the next step is to decide what to do with them. There are several options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation: Bad channels can be interpolated from the nearby 'good' channels to estimate what the signal at the bad electrode might have been.\n",
    "Exclusion: Both bad channels and trials can simply be excluded from further analysis. This is a straightforward approach, but it reduces the amount of data available.\n",
    "Correction Methods: Certain methods can correct artifacts in bad trials, such as regression methods or signal-space projection. These can be quite effective but are also more complex.\n",
    "By effectively managing bad channels and trials, we can ensure the highest possible data quality for subsequent analyses.\n",
    "In our case, we will interpolate the bad channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Always consider the impact of your decisions at this stage on the later stages of your analysis pipeline. This will help to ensure the integrity and reproducibility of your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#1496BB\">Question: One of the key challenges in EEG analysis is deciding how to handle bad channels and trials. If you discover that a significant proportion of your data is \"bad\" (e.g., more than 30% of your channels or trials), how might this influence your analysis strategy?

    "- Downsampling: Downsampling is a process of reducing the sampling rate of the signal. This reduces the size of the data and can improve computational efficiency in subsequent analyses. Note that downsampling should only be done after applying a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.\n",
